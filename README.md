## Objective
The aim is to construct precise 3D maps using sets of images in diverse scenarios and environments. We develop a model to generate accurate spatial representations, regardless of the source domainâ€”images taken from drones, amidst dense forests, during nighttime, or any of the six problem categories. The process of reconstructing a 3D model of an environment from a collection of images is called Structure from Motion (SfM).
